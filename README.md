An SQL rpg 
==========

Welcome to theÂ **SQL RPG Database**! This is a fun and quirky project designed to simulate a classic RPG (Role-Playing Game) entirely within a SQL database. Whether you're a SQL wizard or just starting your journey, this project is packed with humor, creativity, and a touch of chaos. Dive in and explore a world whereÂ **Soggy Slimes**,Â **Angry Chickens**, andÂ **The World-Eater**Â await you!

**Features**
------------

### **1\. Classes & Jobs**

Choose your destiny with a variety ofÂ **Classes**Â andÂ **Jobs**! Will you be a mighty Warrior, a cunning Rogue, or perhaps a wise Mage? Each class has unique base stats, and jobs add exciting modifiers to spice things up.

*   **Classes:** Hilarious takes on Warriors, Mages, Rogues, Clerics, and more!
    
*   **Jobs**: Funky Fisherman, Bumbling Blacksmith, Nerdy Nomad, Loony Librarian, and...Â **Hangry Chef**? (Okay, maybe not that last one.)
    

### **2\. Characters**

Create your hero and embark on an epic adventure! Customize your character's name, class, job, and stats. Will you beÂ **Sir Stabs-a-Lot**Â orÂ **Magey McFireball**? The choice is yours!

### **3\. Zones & Enemies**

Explore 11 unique zones, each with its own theme and difficulty. From theÂ **Noob Fields**Â (where even a soggy slime can be a challenge) to theÂ **Demonâ€™s Throne**Â (where theÂ **Demon Emperor**Â awaits), there's no shortage of danger.

*   **Zones**: Dank Swamps, Volcanic Depths, Cursed Forest, and more!
    
*   **Enemies**: FightÂ **Grumpy Rats**,Â **Lava Imps**, and evenÂ **The Slightly Bigger Slime**Â (yes, it's a thing).
    

### **4\. Weapons & Equipment**

Arm yourself with an arsenal of ridiculous weapons and gear. From the humbleÂ **Bendy Butterknife**Â to the legendaryÂ **Excalibruh**, there's something for every adventurer.

*   **Weapons**: Swords, Axes, Bows, Staffs, and evenÂ **Whips**Â (because why not?).
    
*   **Equipment**: EquipÂ **Rusty Buckets**,Â **Patchwork Plating**, andÂ **Dragonhide Gauntlets**Â to boost your stats.
    

### **5\. Potions**

Need a quick boost? Chug a potion! FromÂ **Soggy Bandages**Â toÂ **Phoenix in a Bottle**, these concoctions will keep you alive... probably.

*   **Potion Types**: HP, Attack, Defense, and Speed.
    
*   **Examples**:Â **Mediocre Medicine**,Â **Punch-Packing Potion**, andÂ **Sonicâ€™s Secret Sauce**Â (guaranteed to make you go fast).
    

### **6\. Dynamic Stats**

Your character's stats are calculated dynamically based on their class, job, and equipped items. No more manual updatesâ€”just pure, automated RPG goodness.

**Examples of Fun Stuff**
-------------------------

### **Weapons**

*   **Bendy Butterknife**: Perfect for spreading jam... and maybe stabbing a slime.
    
*   **Excalibruh**: The legendary sword thatâ€™s seen better days.
    
*   **Planet-Cracking Battleaxe**: Overkill? Maybe. Awesome? Definitely.
    

### **Enemies**

*   **Soggy Slime**: Itâ€™s wet, itâ€™s gross, and itâ€™s coming for you.
    
*   **The Slightly Bigger Slime**: Twice as soggy, twice as dangerous.
    
*   **The World-Eater**: The final boss. Good luck with that.
    

### **Potions**

*   **Soggy Bandage**: Itâ€™s damp, but itâ€™ll stop the bleeding... probably.
    
*   **Phoenix in a Bottle**: Drink this, and youâ€™ll rise from the ashes. Or just get heartburn.
